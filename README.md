# Z-World 🌀

- A simple microblog web project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for learning purposes.
- Any user accessed can feel free to post messages, like, reply, and delete—all on one page.
- This system does not have a database, which means any edits on the page cannot be stored after refreshing the web.

## 📁 Folder Structure
This web app uses a very classic and basic file structure.
```
Z-World/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   └── styles.css
└── js/
    └── script.js
```

## 💡 Features
- Post new messages with an optional username
- Like, reply, and delete posts
- Search bar to filter posts by keyword
- Responsive and clean UI with CSS styling

## 🧠 Notes
- No backend: all data exists in memory (JavaScript `posts[]` array)
- Once the page is refreshed, all content is lost
- Built for practice and demonstration purposes
